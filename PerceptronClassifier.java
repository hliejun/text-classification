// 6. For each class, learn the perceptron classifier based on text vectors
    // a) set initial weight (incl. x0, w0)
    // b) iterate through N samples (do we do passes too?)
        // i) classify sample with every weight vector (dot product)
        // ii) after classification, run training rule to update weight vectors
    // c) obtain converged weight vector for each class
